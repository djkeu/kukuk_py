=== No failures found ===
=== Multiple seemingly random doublures found ===
- Set alarms_callback interval to 1 / 10.1
    - Leads to (more?) doublures
- Set alarms_callback interval to 1 / 10.001


[INFO   ] [Base        ] Start application main loop
(.. abundant logs removed ..)
[INFO   ] [Base        ] Leaving application in progress...


=== Changed interval doesn't solve the problem ===
- Abandon this approach and revert to time.sleep(1)
- Remove multiseconds from the alarms 


[INFO   ] [Base        ] Start application main loop
(.. abundant logs removed ..)
[INFO   ] [Base        ] Leaving application in progress...


=== This works, just like it did before the attempt to get rid of time.sleep(). ===
=== I guess it was a nice waste of time. I hope I learned something from it. ===
