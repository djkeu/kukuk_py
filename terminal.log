=== Problem at 00:00:00 solved ===
- No further action


=== Double alarm at 19:30:00.1 ===
Actions:
- Test on a minutely instead of hourly basis


(.. abundant logs removed ..)


=== No failures found ===
=== Multiple seemingly random doublures found ===

- Set alarms_callback interval to 1 / 10.1
    - Leading to more doublures
- Set alarms_callback interval to 1 / 10.001


[INFO   ] [Base        ] Start application main loop
(.. abundant logs removed ..)


=== Changed interval doesn't solve the problem ===
- Abandon this approach and revert to time.sleep(1)
- Remove multiseconds from the alarms

=== This works, just like it did before the attempt to get rid of time.sleep(). ===
=== I guess it was a nice waste of time. I hope I learned something from it. ===
