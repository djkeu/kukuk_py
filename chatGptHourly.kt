    Use when statement instead of long if..else ladder:

As the TODO suggests, it is better to use a when statement instead of a long if-else ladder. This makes the code more concise and easier to read. Here's an example:


val times = when {
    i < 13 -> i - 0
    else -> i - 12
}


    Use Kotlin's built-in date/time APIs:

Instead of using Date and SimpleDateFormat from the Java API, it is recommended to use Kotlin's built-in date/time APIs. Here's an example:


val currentTime = LocalTime.now()
val hour = currentTime.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("HH:mm:ss"))


    Consider using a more efficient way to check if the current time matches the alarm time:

Instead of iterating over all the hours and checking if each hour matches the current time, it would be more efficient to calculate the next alarm time and use a delay to wait until that time. Here's an example:


private suspend fun hourlyAlarms() {
    while (true) {
        val currentTime = LocalTime.now()
        val nextHour = currentTime.plusHours(1).withMinute(0).withSecond(0)
        delay(Duration.between(currentTime, nextHour).toMillis())
        kukuMultipleTimes(currentTime.hour % 12 + 1)
    }
}


This code calculates the next alarm time by adding one hour to the current time, setting the minute and second to 0, and then waiting for that time using a delay. It then calls kukuMultipleTimes with the current hour, modulo 12 plus 1, to get the correct number of chimes. This approach is more efficient because it avoids the need to loop over all the hours, and it also allows the function to keep running indefinitely, triggering alarms every hour.
